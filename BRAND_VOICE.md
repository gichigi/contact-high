# ContactHigh Brand Voice Guide

## The Philosophy

ContactHigh proves that **killer brand voice can make any simple idea interesting**. We take mundane contact management and make it feel like a conversation with your slightly chaotic but endearing friend.

## What ContactHigh Actually Does

**The Core Function:** ContactHigh just logs when and where you saved your contacts to your phone. It doesn't save contacts - it enhances the ones you already have.

**The Real Problem:** When you save a contact, there's no easy way to remember their name or where you met them later. If you don't call or text them immediately, it's hard to ever find them again. This applies to romantic connections, friendships, business networking - especially when you do a lot of networking.

**The Solution:** With ContactHigh, you don't have to say "let me quickly text you now" or "let me just ring you once." It just works. In fact, it's insane that Apple/Samsung haven't added this as a native feature of their contacts apps.

**The Value:** Never again will you scroll through your contacts thinking "what's their name again?" "I can't find their contact." ContactHigh gives you the context you need to actually follow up with people you've met.

## Core Tone Principles

### 1. **Honest About Limitations**
- We don't oversell. We're "kinda" location aware, not "revolutionary GPS tracking"
- We admit when we're not perfect: "Remember who you met (kinda)"
- We're realistic: "No more awkward 'wait, who are you?' moments" (but we know there will still be some)

### 2. **Playfully Self-Aware**
- We know our app is simple, and we're okay with that
- We use parenthetical asides to show we're thinking out loud
- We're not trying to be the next unicorn startup

### 3. **Relatable & Human**
- We speak like real people, not marketing robots
- We acknowledge the awkwardness of forgetting names
- We use casual, conversational language

## Vocabulary & Language Patterns

### Key Words & Phrases
- **"kinda"** - Our signature qualifier that shows we're not overselling
- **"wait, who are you?"** - The universal awkward moment we're solving
- **"foggy memories"** - How we describe the problem we're solving
- **"social butterflies"** - Our target audience (alongside founders and flirts)

### Sentence Structure
- **Parenthetical asides**: "At 2:14AM." We don't ask questions, we just log it.
- **Casual contractions**: "what's his name, again?" not "what is his name, again?"
- **Conversational questions**: "What was his name? Mark? Matt?"
- **Self-deprecating humor**: "Made with foggy memories"

### Voice Characteristics
- **Casual but not sloppy**: Professional enough to be trusted, casual enough to be relatable
- **Slightly chaotic**: We embrace the messiness of human memory
- **Endearing**: We're the friend who's a bit scattered but means well
- **Confident in our simplicity**: We don't need to be complex to be valuable
